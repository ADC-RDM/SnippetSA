28 TON CHRISTMAS BOX,

Wo are to-dny in receipt of the Chriat-
mas Farmer's Advocate and Home
Magnzine, of London, Opt. ; and, upon
examination of its beantiful cover nnd
contents, have no hesitation in saying
that the fortunate renders of thdt ever-
popular periodical are receiving a veri-
table trent. The Advocate peopls cor.
tainly use their readers well. Besides
all the good things of the year, they re-
ceive this superb number complimen-
tary. Among the various holiday pub-
lications, this one stands in the. very first
rank In regard both to matter and {llus-
tration. Io shorts the number is not
only an entainer, but an educator, As
usoal, it is an exponent of the highest
type of Canadian art, being illustrated
by over 100 photogravores and repro-
ductions of paintings by eminent Cann-

dino artists ; while i¢ contains’ over 60:

especially-written artioles, all of except-
fonnlg merit, of which some deal with
subjects of practical agricultural value,
no department of the farm being over-
looked, some with scenery and methods
of life in different parts of our great
Dominion, while others appeal to the
nature student, the educationist and to
the devoteo of literature. Wor its puob-
lication no less than over 28 tons of paper
wereteqnired. We heartily coogratul-
ato the Farmer's Advocate on its suo-
cess, and are glad to seo that it is about
tondd still more to its efficacy in ad-
vancing the farming interest of the
conntry by being issued henceforth
woekly. Its Home Dopartwent is also
being greatly strengthened, which pop-
ularizes the Advocate more than ever
with the homo-makers of our country.
For the home life, as well as for our
agrioultural and live-stock interests, thy
Farmer's Advocate oontinaea to render
the very best kind of service.
