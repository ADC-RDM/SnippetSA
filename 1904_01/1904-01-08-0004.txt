facts of the Wigle Oreek cases arc as
follows :—On_the 1st of Juve, 1897,
eight actions were brought against the
township of Gosfield Soath clovmiog
damages cansed by the No. 47 Tap
Drain, constructed by Gosfield, Town -
ship before its division into Gusfield
North and Gosfleld Scuth, and claiming
a mandamus to compel the township to
construct 8 r oatlst to Tap Drain
No. 47 and an injuoction restraiulog
the township from throwing water
Bj she plaintiffs’ lands. Frideao

igle and Mary H. Ras brought their
actions in the High Court of Justice and
Philip Wigle, Jonas Wigle, Alvio
Wigle, Joshua Adams, E.

: Jonas Wigle $38 70; Alvin Wigle
$103; Joshua Adams $115; E. A Pal-
ford $:5, and Theodore Wigle $70 to-
sther with costs of the actions, all to

the Coartol A

ment oa the 20d of March, 1001, hold-
ing that Gosfield North was 8 necessary
to the action and referring, it back
to the Referce to add Gosfield North
proceed with tho reference. Gos-
field Noeth was added sccording to the
judgment and the cases came on again
for hearing before Mr. Rankin, K.O..
¢ who had succeeded Mr. Hodgins as
Drainage Referee, and Mr. Rankin,
after hearing the further evidence sub-
mitted, gave judgment on the 30th of
August, 1902, by which he increased
the damages in some instances.avnd in
. addition decided thac the plaintiffs were
-entitid to an iojangtion to restrain
both fuwnshive from continuing the
damage to the plaiutiffs’ land. Boih
townships appealed from Mr, Raokin's
reportsud their appeal was heard by the
Court of Appeal. on the 20:b of April,
1908. Judgment was given by the
Coart of Appeal ou the Gth of January.
1904, whereby the coart holds thac both
townships are jointly liable for saca
damages us the plaintiffs: are entitled to
but that the. plaintiffs are not entitled
to the damages claimed by the actions
and are only entitled to the damages

sustained forthe two years pr
10th ot September, 1901, when Gosfleld

North became a party to the actions. |

The court decides that the plaintiffs are
not entitled to any injanetion against the
townships to prevent the use of the drain
for their waters and refers the action
back sgnin to the Refereo to ascertain
the amount of damages pay-
able. parties are ordered to pay their
own costa of the appeals. The Court re-
commends that the parties make an ad-
jnstment withoat the farther interven-
tion of the Referee. A.H. Clarke, K.O..

manner, as a. forth in a bulletin that
the Missouri board of agriculture is
distributing among the farmers of the
state. After the sane experience with
roads that other stites have had, good
a little while and then bad a long
while, it was mygested by some one

the road runing past his own farm
all the roads would soon be in good

land, who with some {ngenuity set
about making a drag for himself, and
it {s this dng that is the subject of
the state board's bulletin. The bul
letin describes it us follows:

“The road drag Is very simply con-
structed. It & composed of two split
logs nine fest long. jolned together
with short crosspleces. After each rain
the road should be gone over with the
drag. carefully smoothing down all the
high’ places and filling up the ruts. In
the course of time the road €o treat:
will become hard and firm and, with a
little attention after each rain, always
remain dry and smooth. Experiments
have been made In every part of the
state and on every kind of soil with
the drag, and it bas been found to be
successful.”

We take pleasure in presenting this
Missouri {dea to our readers, says the
Des Moines Register and Leader. It is
the solution of the road problem in

every farmer ought to be willing to
combine with his neighbors to secure a
road tender, whose business it should
be to keep our dirt highways smooth

Every township in the state should
have a man, with suficient teams and
tools, hired by the year to do nothing
else. In one year nine out’ of ten of
our dirt highways, would become €o
