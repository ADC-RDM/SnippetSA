RESTLESS AND CROSS.

When iinfants or young children are
restless snd cross or peevish it is a very
certain sigh that they are not well. The
mother may not know just what se
n it
tha tronble exists: Give the little one
Baby's Own Tinblets see how promptly
it will be changed into o happy, smiling,
good natured child, The little one will
sleep soundly and naturally and the
mother will also obtain her mach nseded
rest Hero ia the proof given by Mis,
Jobn E. Ramany, Port Hill, P., E I,
who says:~—"'My baby waa cross, restless
and did not sleep wall, but after giving
him Baby's Own Tablets he became
better natured, sleeps well and is grow-
fug finely. The tablota have been a
great blessing to both baby and myself.”

The Tablets are a prompt and certain
ours for such troubles ws indigestion,
sour stomach, collo, constipation
diarrhaa, simple fevers and other minor
aliments. They always do good and
cannot possibly barm the most delicate
obild. Yoo can get the Tablets from
any medicine dealer, or they will ba sent
