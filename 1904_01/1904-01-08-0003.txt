seedsmen for many years and has been
occanfonally grown by some of our
farmers. Within the past two or three
years seedamen in different parts of
the country have advertised what as a
result of our comparisons it is conciuds’
ed Is precisely the game variety under
new pames. The names which have
been brought to our attention, says
Professor Wiliam P, Brookes of Maa-
sachusetts Agricultural college in
Hoard's Dalryman, are Matd's Winder
Forage Crop aud Brazilian millet. Seed
offered’ under these names was pros
cured In preparation for this season's
work from the so called originators or
Introducers, We also secured seed from
some of our prominent seedsmen, who
in turn had secured from would be in.

sons throughout the entire scason fall-
ed to disclose any ditterence. Mand's
Wonder and Brazilian miiiet, so exiled,
appear to be identical In every way
with Pear] millet. The latter seed can
usually be obtained of scedrmen at
about 10 cents per pound. When bear:
ing new names the prices charged are
much in excess of this figure:

Such trials of Pearl millet na have
been made herethave Jed to the conclu-
slon that It Is not a crop which 18 likely
to prove of any considerable value un:
less it may be upon very light, dry and
warm soils, The crop bay been de-
scribed and commented upon at length
in previous repotts.

It will be seen that after most care.
ful trinl and comparison it is my belief
that both Brazilinn millet and Mand’s
Wonder are new only in name, If
farmers desire to make a trial of this
crop, they should order Pearl millet of
reliable acedsmen. This can be bought
probably at about one-fourth the price
which 1 understand ia being charged
for thé same thing under the name
of Brazilian millet.

Feeding Helfers,

Don't feed a heifer that is intended
for the dairy large quantities’ of fat
producing food, but an abundance of
good hay and a Mmited supply of oats
and corn, for the habit of laying on
flesh in cnlfhood is liable to follow her
to motherhood and Jeadl to her placing
the results of heavy feeding on her
back instead of in the milk pail.

Farm Feeds For Cows.

Those in attendance at the meeting
of the Illinois Dairy association at
Freeport were interested in the discus-
slon by M. OC. Campbell of Dekalb
county on the best methods of using
available farm feeds. Mr. Campbeit
began figuring on the ‘cost of feed And
decided upon the following, which he
used during December: Silage, clover
hay, shredded fodder and oat straw.
Kecping a strict account of everything,
he found that a herd of twelve cows
during Decomber gave him a clear
profit of $00. Eleven cows fed during
the previous month on high priced
feeds returned very small profits. This
ration of course contains considerable
grain in the silage. It does not, how.
ever, contain a large amount of pro-
tein, altheugh a fair quantity is fur
nished by the clover hay. Mr. Camp
bell found that after the first few days
the flow of milk was maintained, and,
so far as he could determine, the ani-
mals did not decrease In flesh.

When protein feed is cheap, ho be-
Heves it {s advisable to feed more of
this material, but under the present
conditions he does not think he is war.

good results from the grains snd
