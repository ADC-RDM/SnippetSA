MR. LYTTLETON.

“Tay Pay” Sketch of ihe New Coloniaf®
Necretary.

Mr. T. ¥. O'Connor, in his Mainly.
About People, says of Mr Lyttleton,
the new Colopinl Secretary: Mr. Lyt-
tleton is tall and thin, and walks
with the enormously quick stride of
tho athlete In perfect condition. Xe
has n dark complexion, dark halr,
rather inclined to be curly, dark
eyes; altogether is of the Celtic or
Spanish rather than the Saxon type
of man. He has, ‘like all his broth-
ers and cousins, an alr of distinction,
and of a certain unworldliness; ho
might be a muscular clergyman or a
muscular barrister, as he is; in any
caso, there fs about him a certain
look of elevation and abstraction,
such as one would expect in a man
who had either a very devotional or
a very poetic nature. In any case,
hig face is that of a man with a fine
mind and a sweet nature, and it Is
no wonder that ho is, for that ren
son, a universally popular man. Probe
ably one of tho main reasons Why
Ar. Balfour selectad Mr. Lyttleton as
his colleague was a certain forlorn-
ness in his own position, and the
tendency that such forlornness is cal-
culated to create. If a Minister
finds that he {5 at last thrown back
on himself, he must seck his support
and his comradeship in men whom be
can trust not merely as political as-
sociates, but ‘as warm personal
friends, Now {t iy sald constantly of
Mr. Ballour that, though he Is a
staunch and loyal political associate,
and though hp is 0 man to go to in
an emergency, he is not a man of
warm, ardent, or frequent affections.
It has been stated that he really
does not caro for anybody much out-
side of n cortain fow; and there have
been those who have said that out-
side of his own family, the one nan
Mr. Balfour has ever reaily cared for
is Alfred Lyttleton. And, perhaps,
that as much as hia talents—which
are far greater than have been repre-
sentod—ia why Mr. Lyttleton Is Co=
lonfal Secretory.

New Zenland's Arbitration Act

Accarding to Public Opinlon (New
York), Mr. R. J, Seddon, Premier of
New Zealand, writes a long letter to
The London Times, in answer to
various criticisma of the Arbitration
Act in his colony. Ho sums up by
declaring that sinco the act has been
in operation there has been no  at-
tempt at strike or lockout that hus
not been instantly baffled and the dis-
pute adjusted. The colony, he as
sorts, hos enjoyed steadily increasing
prosperity; as shown not only by ra-
apidly increasing exports, but by the
expansion of values of machinery,
plants, output, otc., in manufactures,
and the Increased amount of wages
paid, viz.,, £1,907,592 in 18905, as
compared with £3,098,561 in 1900.
Every trade in the colony, ho aays,
is in full work, while tho arrivals of
immigrants from Australian alone ex-
cead by 10,000 for tho year the num-~
her of departures. No better eovi-
dence of tho good dono by the Arbi=
tration Act ia needed, he thinks,
than ite imitation by neighboring
atates, Ho predicts that a similar
Inw will bo cstablished soon in gvery
Australian colony. All this is In
very striking contrast with the cone
tonts of another letter from an Aus~
tralian, who says that, he recently
questioned a number of workingmen,
who wore emigrating from New Zea-
land to Argentine, as to why they
were-leaving the country. Thay re-
plied that it was because thore was
no chance of their rising out of tho
ruck of labor.

| New Metuod of Uguniling Adapted In
Farts of Englad—Vower Supplied

Direct to Joluts Required.

_ A system of ebetro-pncumatic ig

‘naling has bem installed. by the
Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
Company at tls new Dolton sta-
tion, now sppeaching completion:

The system employed depends for
$ts nection upun a combination of wir
| and electricky. Tho points and sig-

nals, insteat of being operated by

means of rods and wires, pecessitat-
ing considemble manual power, are
operated by air motors, ono of which

{8 connected to each pair of” points
| and each'sipmal.

The motom are driven by compress-
ed alr at a pressure of about 70
pounds per square inch, and are plac-
ed in all caes as close as possible to
the points sr signals which they op-
erate,

Fach cylinder {is provided with
volves to wntrol the inlets from the
alr main and theses valves are open-
ed and closed by means of olectro-
magnets actuated by electric clir-
rents {mm the signal-box. Thus the
power is applied directly at the point
at which {ts services wre required,
and {5 mbjfect to the central control
of the signalman. This control is
oxenzised by means of ou frame of min-
intize lovers,

Anplo measures are provided by
mmns of auxiliary electrical circuits
to guard against ao signal being
lowered unless the points which {it
controls are actually in thefr correct
position, and in tho case of facing
points to ensure that they are also
tocurely bolted jn that position.

An ingenious feature is what is
known as the ‘‘check-locking’’ ar-
rangement. This ensures that until
the movement of a point or signal
has beon fully completed the lever in
the signal-box which is concerned is
checked when about three-quarters of
its stroke i» accomplished,

As soon ns the signal or point
movement, as the case may be, is
properly completed, the ‘‘check-lock’’
is’ electrically removed and the sig
nalman is enabled to pull the lever
fully over. Until he has done so the
mechanical locking in the frame pre
vents the movement of any contin
gent point or signal lovers, which
are thus holddocked, until the move-
ment of any necessary points has
actunlly been completed.

ROYAL WEDDING CAKES.

One of the Largest on Record Made in
Louden.

‘The wedding cake of Princess Alice
of Battenberg, who was recently
married ot Darmstadt to Princes
Andreas of Greece, was ordered in
London.

Standing some six fect high, it was
one of tho largest cakea over mado
for a roys) ‘bride, although that
presented to Princess Doatrice by the
ladies of Kent was about twenty
inches taller. The latter masterpiece
in confectionery cost 500 guineas.

It is a rulo at royal weddings to
have four or flve cakes, ono of which
ia made by the bride's awn cooks,
and cut up for despatch to her par-
ticular friends.

Among humbler brides thers is
growing demand for cakes mado
o single “tier,” the prico generally
pald varying from ten to fifteen
guineas. 1t is seldom, according to
an authority, that mors than the
latter sum is paid for a bride's cake,

oven at a fashionable wedding.

Am Exirasrdinary Incident,

The closing days of Lord Tchny-
son's vicgregal career in Australia
have been marked by an oxtraordi-
nary incident. © A young man of
twenty-five, named Robert Montgom-
ory Parker, sald to be the son of a
wealthy Liverpool merchant, has been
on a tour through America, China
and Japan. * His stay in the Far
East upset hin mental balance, for
immediately on arriving in Melbourne
ho rushed to the ofMces of the East~
mn Extension Telsgraph Company
and excitedly handed in a batch of
messages for immediate transmission
to the Lords of tho Admiralty, Lord
Curzon, the admirals in command of
the British naval stations, and vari-
ous other official personages. All
these messages were signed “Tenny-
son,’ and conveyed the alarming in-
telligence that Russia had declared
war against England; Tho receiving
clerk diagnosed the situation necur-
ately, told the poor fellow that (ho
great seal of the Coypmonwealth’ was
necessary for such messages, and tefe-
phoned to Government Houss and the
police. A fow minutes later ho was
arrested at Government Housp, over-
powered, and deprived. of a fully-
loaded revolver. His diary showed
that ho had made on close study of
affairs in the Far Fast. .

Cannon Lamp Foste.

The earlier laump-posts in London,
Bays The Magavine of Art, wore
evolved from the fnnnon discarded as
obsolete or faulty after the Napol-
vonic wars. These actual service
cannon were freely used at Woolwich
and probably other garrison towns,
as strect corner-posts, tho bore bee
ing plugged with ook to keep out the
rain and refuse, the emerging ond of
the plug being shaped in hemisphor-
ical form to ropresent the issue of a
cannon-ball. Latter. on theso real
cannon wore superseded by imitation
iron castings, the hall cannon-bail
and all. * This cunnon pattern for
_corner-posts found its way to Lon-
don, where it may still bo seen in
many of cur oldor streets and
sguarcs. Frm the unenlarged cor-
ner-post of the cannon pattern
omorged tho lamp-post of tho period,
hich is familiar in London to this

Ioipressions Afier a Your's Teaching
the Canadian “Tom browh" Utility
and Cuolture—The Claszice—Reoliglous
tilde of Bchoel Life—Whare Canada Is
Buperior.

Principal Auden’s outlook upon
edtication In Candda combines =the
fresh viewpoint of the traveler with
that of the actual citizen, He came
hero a stramger, has already gone
from coast to coast, has assumed tho
leadership of Canada’s chief Public
Schaal, and spont tho best part of
one year in practical experience with
Canadian youth, says The Toronto
Newa.

A pedagogue Is commonly said to
be rocognize at sight Principn)
Auden would pass quite as readily
for an Anglican Canon or ao man of
letters. His habitual cast is grav-
ity—not of tho scowling, trudite sort
that inspired the portrayal of Gold-
smith's schoolmaster, but the sedate
polse that.merks a man cousclaous al
a great life-work. Naturally, he is
chief in this country of a class be-
coming all too rare in these days of
feminine pedagogy in Public Schogls.

Nis Point of View,

Ho is not an orator, Neither is ho
an experimental faddist. He stands
as an academic ‘descendent of Arnold
of Rugby. His point of view {s that
of the cultured Englishman; his ot-
mosphers that of the English Public
School after the manner of ton,
Winchester and Rugby. Such schools
existed in England when Upper Can-
ada College was the sito of an In-
dian ¢amp. Less than o century hus
seen the development of an educa-
tional system in this country em-
bodying many of ‘tho best traditions
of England. ‘Tom Brgwn" is also
a Canadian. And to the mun whose
life-work is to educate the Canadian
Tom Drown, cdugational prablems in
thiy young land are replete with ori-
ginal interest,

RBezidentis) vs. Day Scheels.

Principal Auden believes that Can-
ada deeds more residential schools.
The absorption of parents in com~
mercial pursults naturally minimizes
culture in tho home. Doys are left
largely to their own devices, to
promiscuous contact with lads not
of their own age, and to the perilous
influences of the street, This begets
mannishness and loud manners. (Can.
adian parents ure often absent from
their families on business matters
and hpome-building in the West, Tho
day school cannot efficiently look
after such boys, Moreover, tho doy
school tends to muchine methods and
the dbliteration of a teacher's Pers
‘sonality, whereas the boarding school
substitutes the constant personal «<in-
fluence of nn house-master who de-
votes hig whole time to his pupils.

Utility and Oulturo,

As to utilitarian yp. culture stud-
fas, Mr. Auden observes a wendenty
among us to exait the former.” This
{8 natural jn a new country where
commerce takes precedence of cullure,
Boys are imbued with the instinct
of vocation-htnting before they are
ablo to spell the words of a common
lettar. This leuds to a desire for
specinlization at an early oge, and
tends to sacrifice the all-¥ound dove
lopment necessary for safe cltizon-
ship, Culture, however, is on the
increase, - Parents gre finding © moro
time to tutor their own children.
Canadian homes are getting an ab-
mosphere in which good literature,
art and monners are becoming char
acteristic,

A knowledge of practical science,
tho Principal considers, ls necessary
for every boy. Science has recently
become a main factor in civilization.
A man can scarcely becalled a mod-
ern citizen who does not know tho
rudiments of physic, chemistry. and
electricity. This is a new develop
ment. Manual training he regards 3
n good thing to engage a boy's sur-
plus activities, but believes Jt far
less necessary here than in England,
where boys have pot the natural
handiness that distinguishes Cans~
dian youth. He also observes that
Canadian boys are more imbued with
tho spirit of practical progress, a
useful stimulus in the class-room.
Tho inherent danger of this, how-
over, consists in the tendency to
crowd curriculums with courses of
study, to rush pupila through schools
too rapidly, and to make examina-
tions the end rather than the means
of & sound education—which the Prin-
cipal considers bas nothing to do
with either typewriting or steno-
graphy.

d English and the Classics.

The vexed question of Claasics &
English us a means of culture has
much engaged tho attention of Prin-
cipal Auden. As an Englishman, he
naturaily cleaves to the cinsscs. Ho
regards Latin and Greek as essential
parts of a true education. Latin ho
commends no less, for its disciplinary
value than as a means of compre-
hending tho structure of English,
Latin makes a boy think no less
than mathematics. It ia the world's
model of concise structure, consistent
grammar and logical syntax. A Hoy
should learn . his grammar {in tha
Latin, which in the mol of Eng-
lish grammar. The un od ne-
cessity ‘of this explains why Latin
Sites as a dally item fn the U.C.0,
timetable in all but one form,
Greek {ns considered as an fndispen-
sable model for styls, and

At first blush jt seems a paradox
that an English master should give
tuo, dead Ianguages precedence over
| the lan, of Chaucer, Shak aro
| and en yion, as a source ot Eng
1 lish culture. But it must be remem~
| bered that decent English is second
! nature to an EngHshi boy. Ha
| knows his Shakespeare independent of
| the echool master, reads botter
books, scans o larger percentage of
| dignified newspapers and listens to
| moro standard English speeches. In
| ghis country wo are yet subject to
| rustic dinlect, bad patois, Amcrican-
fsmy oud forefgn languages. There-
fore, English as a definite object ol
study is tenfold more necessary here
than in England. Principal Auden
wisely belloves that great models of
poctry and prose should not be sub-
jected to the indignity of grammati-
cal anulysis; neither should English
words be. laboriously parsed.
Bible fheunld ¥eo Taught,

As to religious instruction, the

“Principal believes that the Bible
should be taught in the schools. He

also contends that the best gospel of
all in the personal, every<dny re-
ligion of a teacher's life and charac-
ter. Regarding women as teachers,
ho believea that they are oo shining
success with young pupils, but funda
mentally lacking the gift necessary
to enlorce discipline among boys
above the elementury forms.

As students of French and German
they excel, but as teachers of these
languages, are rather prone to miss
the deeper meaning of a trapsiation.
Their appointment here to tho very
best posts in the modern language
courses of collegiate institute stands
as an agreeable contrast to the Xng-
lish practice of paying a man three
or four times pa much as a woman
for doing the samo work.

Another obvious superiority of the
Canadian over the English education
al system is the establishment of ag-
ricultural colleges. Such institutions
as tho O. A. C. would be a sheer im~
possibility in England, where agri~
culture is largely traditional and,
in fact, fast becoming obsolete.

AN HOUR IN THE WOODS.

A Oity Father's Outing With His Bey en
Saturday Afisrsesn,

The boy didn’t know what to do
with himself. I didn't know what to
do with myself. It was a lovely af-
ternoon. E decjded that a lesson in
nature study wouidn’t do either of
us any, harm, so off to the woods we
want.

1 had been there before in spring
aad summer, but not in late autumn.
The trees were there with some
touches of autumn glory lingering in
tho faded leaves, but the air was
still, and there seemed
about. But only for a little, for
alter climbing the slippery hilluide
wo dropped in on a sociable party of
song sparrows wino had not yet gone
south. Bul they were shy and wary,
and the boy and 1 did not get much
more than a glimpse of them. Not
50 with the white-brensted nuthatch,
however, and the boy watched in-
terestedly as I showed him the bird
traveling gravely headsdownward on
tho tree trunks looking® tor insects.
Further on we caught a flash ‘of blues
as o shy bluejay “dashed squalling
into o thicket. Wo walked a little
further to where tho ever-greens that
bad been favorite haunts of the red-
starts in summer time grew in ver-
dure untarnizhed by Artist Autumn's
brown paint pot and busy brush, and
2lld down through the dead leaves to
the foot of the ravine, where  o

downy woodpecker beat his fesble,
tattoo on o dead tree, and here IV

showed the boy how the little wood-
pecker held hig tail feathers against
the bark to give his busy bill the
batter leverage, Now we were home
ward bound, and after a space tho
familiar *‘chich-a-dee-dee’’ saluted” un
and wo got into a whole family of
the busy little blackcaps feeding in-
dustriously and calling ¢hesrily to
cach other right under our very nos-
cs. Tho boy was delighted, for the
birds came within three feet of us as
we stood breathle8dly silent beneath
the cedars watching their restless fit-
ting. 2 showed him one bird diving
into tho curled up leaf that somo
grub had selected fon his winter
quarters, little dreaming when he did
it that a little black~capped chickadees
would ome day find him out, pull
him from his lair} eat him, and then
wipe his bill on twig while two
admiring mortals looked on. Among
tho chickadees we saw ono kinglet—
thoy often travel together in the fall
and winter—and then wo left them
to finish ‘their suppers unobserved.
There were only one or two things
yet to show the boy before the city
claimed us. One was the
sand which the bank swallows had
pierced in a hundred places during the
summer and had reared their families
therein, und. it was not surprising to
find that what the summes-loving
swallows had Jeft had béen sppro-
prin by that extremely adjustable
individual, the English spafrow.
Along. the lake shore o great gull
brooded, and a little further along a
grobo swam, diving for en uncon-
scionable length ot time when a
noisy locomotive snorted by. Then
the street cars and home, tho lesson
in natural history was ended.—H, D.
