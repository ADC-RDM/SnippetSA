The Soil That Breeds Fine Horses.
In describing experiments made for
tho department of agriculture on the
effects of lime and magnesia upon ani-

it is a well known fact that tho great-
cat development in lve stock has been
attained in limestone reglons. He adds
that 1a the blue grass region of Ken-
tucky, long noted for the beauty and
uality of its lve stock and especially
if its thoroughbred horses, the soll has
‘@h formed largely by the disiategra-
on ‘af a lmestone very rich in phos
phates, But even in that favored re-
‘glon experiments are under way to de-
termine whether the quality of tho anl-
mals may not bo improved by the ad-
dition of certain mineral elements to
tho food.

DIRECTORS MEETING.

A meeting of the newly-eleoted di.
rectors took place after the business of
the abnual meeting had closed.

Mr. Dewhirst moved and D MoAlister
seconded a vote of thanks to the old
president, James Hedrick, for bis offi.
ofent services during the year. Both
spoke very favorably to the motion.

Mr. Hedrick sald he was not much

On wotion Edwin Plant was re-sleot-

OUTSIDE EXHIBITORS,

Althoogh this was the matter for the
anjon directors, a discussion was started
on the question of allowing stock broed-
ers ontside the county fo compete for
prizes at the union exhibition. There
was a difference of opizion expressed.
There were those who thought shat ex.
tousive breeders and feeders bad a groat
advantage over the ordinary farmer. ft
was stated that this outaids competition
was driving the ordinary breeder aw:y
from the fairs.

On the other bsad, it was represented
that first-olass animals at the fair had
an edaoative value more than all the
prizes taken, Through these breeders,
our farmers, especially our yooug farm-
ere, could be shown what cao be done
by good breeding and good feediog. It
shonid be a stimuloos to such. To ex-
clude these, it was thonght by some
present, to bola backward move.

The matter will no doubt come up be-
fore the union directorate.

which is pracically the only property

foipalities. Lhe tax will not boon any
assoasmon Of the wires, but will be

np sean railways will, ander tho
aow bill, Ja taxed ou a new basis of as-
sessmont, which will cover their rails
and roadind as well as their land and
real propaty.

The poposed Railway Commission
will likely be omisted.

The so:mlled hoase tax, ander which
it was priposed to tax every household.
or nooading to the rental he paid, will
also bathopped out.

Tho socalled *‘business tax,” which |
if to wok ln something the same man: |
ner in the Ouse of busicess places, wiil be |
retained, snd the iden has fo one or two |
{instances been developed in a somewhat |
radical way. ‘The business tax {a to take |
sho place Of the present personality ‘und |
fnocome tax. great difficulty having been {
experiented ia gating » propor valuation |
of personality and fnocome, A simpio |
basis for sho basiness tax will be adopt-

merchant® it will be 25 per cent. of the |
assessed Valoe of bis premises. That is, |
n store sud the lot on which . it stands |
are nssesed, say, at $40,000. It will pay
taxes ns heretofore, And the tenant who
occupies 1 will be assessed for the busi
ness tax at $10,000. If the ccoopant Is
also the owner, he will not escape the
extra asspsamont. 1}

In tho ease of merchants who carry on |
more than five kinds ot: business ‘under |
one roof thi percentage of the road estate |
that will be takon na the baie of the bus. |
ness tax is riised to 50 per cent. That
is the way the department stores will ba
distinguished.

This business tax will bo given a wide |
application. Under it brewers and dis. |
titers will be placed {a & class by them.
selves. Their buriness tax will be paid
on 135 per cont. of their roslty nespas-
meant, That is, if a brewery property is
usaessed at $100,000, it will uot ouly have
to pay taxes un that $100,000, but also on
an additiopal $125,000 the latter being
the “business tax.’

Something of a similar basis of taxa.
non will be directed sgainst all profes.
sional men, doctors,” Inwyers, aurists,
oculists, and all the rest of them. Law-
yers will pay on a capitalization of the
rental valuo ot their offices, If alawyer
pays $30 & month for this offfos, or $360
o year, then, takiog 5 per cent. as the |
basis of interest, his business tax wonld
be reckoned on $7,200. It is stated that
in the oase of the larger firma this new
arrangement will cause them to pay
abong the samo as did the old income
tax, when true retarns wera made. Tho
new basis will bays tho advantage of
making evasion diffioult.

It will be tho same way with doctors
A dootor owning and praotisiog io a
$10,000 house will pay twice on the
$10,000, once na real estate and again us
a basindss tax.

The bill will be only informally dis.
onssed by the committee befors boing
presented to the House by the Attorney-
General. Ther will bs wn expression
of opfnfon in the House, and afterwards
it will ba referred back sgain to commit.
tee, probably the same commitres ss has
bad it. Many changes may be. made in
the foregoing draft before it reaches the
statute book.

WEEDS

Consumption is a human
weed flourishing best in weak
lungs. Like other weeds it's
easily destroyed while: young;
when old, sometimes im-
possible.

Strengthen the lungs as you
would weak land and the
weeds will disappear.

The best lung fertilizer is
Scott’s Emulsion, Salt pork
is good too, but it is very hard
to digest.

The time to treat consump*
tion is when you begin tryin
to hide it from yourself.-
Others see it, you won't.

Don't wait until you can't
deceive yourself any longer.
Begin with the first thought
to take Scott's Emulsion. If
it isn’t really consumption so
much the better; you will soon

forget it and be better for the
treatment, If it is consump-

ftion you can't expect to be’

cured at once, but if you will
begin in time and will be
rigidly regular in your treat.
ment you will win. :
