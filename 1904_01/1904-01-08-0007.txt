John Haley came down the back
stops, the model and pattern of angry
dejection.. At dight of him Mrs. Cor-
gon frowned. She did not need to be
told her daughter Helen had refused
Johnny's band for the eleventh time.

Mrs. Corson wanted Johnny in the
family. He was such an all round
good fellow. and well to do, to say
nothing of how beautifully his farm
dovetailed with the Corson acres. When
he came abreast of her she could not
help saying, “Well, of nll idiots in the
world you and Helen are certalply the
most {diotic.”

“f fave been a fool,” Johnny ad
mitted lsavngely, “letting a girl keep
mg! dangling after her five years,
Helen wasn't fifteen” —

“Sho has less than the sense of fAf-
teen now, and 80 have you,” Mrs. Cor-
gon interruptéd Impatiently: “Sou

pleading, very mich another. All at
once Helen awote to the knowledge
that she loved bin. She nd rushed to
him at the first word of trouble, mean-
Ing only to sympathize and console. It
wis lils vole, gathetically brave, still
more pathetically full of renunciation,

the
and a busy. season

‘them, She left Halifax on August

oi

which had shown ber what was in her |

own heart. *No; ! can't let you stay,
Helen,” he had sad. letting her hand
alll “I know you tod well. You are so
sorry for me you might come to love
me. Why, I've seen you often and over
got fond of a lame 008. Ever since
this"—a sort of gulp ot the word—
“happened 1 bayve. been 80 glad you |
didn't care for me, because 1 love you
so well T won't Jet you ruin your fu-
ture. I'm a common, crossronds sort— |
nothing like your fine gentlemen, but
at least I can play you fair.” |
Then Helen, by turns bot and cold, |
bad knelt and laid her head on his
shoulder, sobbing out her love and pen- |
ftence. Sho could feel Johnny swal:
lowing bard. But he held obstinately
by. what he had said. It wos the samo
the next day, the next and the next.

At the end of an week Papa Corson
took a hand. “You are trying hard to
tie n millstone around your neck,” he
snid unfeelingly, “I might not object
to that so very much If only tho mill-
stone was willing. Johnny Haley has
got enough to keep two people ont of
the poorhouse, But T've no mighty
strong notion he don't want you. Un-
less you want to make yourselt a
Inughingstock you'll keep out of his
way."

Helen bad not been spoiled all her
twenty years for nothing. She listen-
ed, growing angrier and angrier all the
time. But she turned away without
a word and ten minutes later had bun-
dled her mother into the. phaeton and

| was driving like mad toward the coun-
| try. town. The business that took her
| there wns soon transacted, and then
| tho horses found their heads turned
toward tho Haley farm. There Helen
burst in upon Johnny, locked her hand
in his and sald tremulously over her
shoulder to a man who followed in her
wake with Mrs. Corson on his arm:
“Wo are ready, Dr. Lansing. Plenso |
marry us quickly, no matter what |
Johny says. He—ho may not be quife

right in his mind.” |

Johnny mlmost sprang up. Helen's,
band showk so he knew eho needed

support. Eis eyes wero still bandaged,

SODDING OUT HER LOVE AND PRNIFENCILS
have stuffed her, head so full of novels

and poetry she's’ clean beyond plain,

everydny common pense.”

. “How can I help it?’ Johnny sald
fn a volce of deep Injury. “I didn’t
know. 1 wanted only to show her I
was liberal”

“Oh, you are imbecilof? Ars. Cor-
soni broke in. “As if that-would go
with -a high strung girl. Of course
Helen wants her own way—and gots
it most of the time. But slie thinks
she wants to make great and solemn
sacrifices for the mun she loves. If
sho can't do that she can't love him.
If you were to have smallpox or lose
your farm or break your back—any-
thing, indeed, but break your neck—
she'd want to marry you out of band.”

Think so?’ Johnny asked, grinning
falutly. 3

«I don't think—I know!” Mrs. Cor-
son retorted confidently.

«I reckon I am stupid; scems lke I
ain't. had my right senses except in
horse trading never since T'yé been
courting Helen,” Johnny sald, the grin |
deepening.

«Oh, go along home!” Mra. Corson
retorted. Johnny stood for a minute
like one lost in thought, then squared
his shoulders, brought his heels well
together, sald in a loud, strained volce:
“Goodby, ma'am. TI write, You'ro
mighty near all the mother I’ve ever
known. I'll never forget your good-
ness whether I fetch up in South Afri-
ca or the Klondike, No, I shan’t come
aver ngain. The sooner T'mw off the
better.” Them in a quick, husky whis- |
per, as he best fo kiss her cheek, “You
Masten out for accidents about day after |
tomorrow." .

Perhaps Jolnny A14 not know the ob-
Aurate Miss Helen was standing at the. |
window, wel screened by the venstian
blinds. He nounted his horse and rode
off furigmly. As the mofse of hoofs
dled awyy Mre. Corson sighed deeply,
saying as though to horself: “Poor boy!
It hurts no to think of him wandering
all over thofaco of the earth.”

“Don't wiry, ma,” Helen said, fling
ing open tio blinds. “Johnny is not the
stuff that makes heroes or martyrs or
oven traviers, Poor Johnnyl- If only
he was ni so hopelessly commonplace
I'd mary iim—to please yon and pa.”

“Younye thrown away the chance and |

‘a might good chance,” Mrs, Corsen |

sald, sifilng ahd shaking her head.
Helen lughed merrily. “Why, I can |
marry iin when T please.” 3

She spike with the conscious power

| of yonth and beauty. Judge then her

but the curls on top of his head seem-
ed to wink at the minister, who stood
twiddling the license uncertalnly.

“Lot her go, parson!” Johnny called |
out joyously, drawing Helen a little |
closer. Flo made the responses in a.

usplciousiy strong voice and at the |
“end tossed his blinders to the other
side of tha room.

#Helen!  Sweetheartl  Wite!” he
cried. “1d have to seo you right now,
even If-1t cost mo my eyes. But I'm
not bllnd nor going to be, even though
that cannon cracker did singe my eye-
brows" —

“It fs I who have been blind all these
years,” Helen interrupted. Then catch-
ing the twinkle in her mother's eyes:
“I understand now. You two conspir-
ed to make me sees”

The Xafiirs Thought It a Joke,

1 onco took some Kaffirs from thelr
desolate homes in the more desolate
gorges Deyond the mountain ranges to
the more civilized south. Like most
savages, they looked with stupid indif-
ference at the marvels about them,
and once only were they excited by an
‘incident which opened thelr eyes to
what they considered a most extraor-
dinary and unnatural state of*things.

They were descending a road when
ono of them chanced to remark that ho
was hungry, and the English “gahib"”
bought him some food nt a wayside
shop. The Kaffir saw the money change
hands.

“How is this?” ho inquired in sur-
prise. “Do you have to pay for food in
this country?’

“Certainly.”

“What a country!” cried the man in
amazement. - Then, after pondering
awhile, ho continued doubtfully: “Sup-
pose a man had no money in this coun-
try. He might starve.” ‘

“It is quite posaibld.”

Tho Kaffir shook with uncontrollable
laughter, It was the best joke he had
ever heard, He then explnined the
ridiculous system to his companions,
and they roared fn chorus.—Where
Three Empires Meet.” 3

"MARKS A NEW EPOCH

GANADA'S EXPEDITION TO KEEP HER |
HOLD ON HUDSON BAY.

Will Drive Out American Whalers and
Close Inlst to Any But British Bhip-

ping— Will Also Rohofst the Dritlelr
Flag on All the Islands of the Archi-

.polage Forming Northern Boundary
of Hudson Hay. :

The despatch by the Dominion Gov-
ernment of an expedition to Hudson
Bay marks a new epoch in the no-
status of tho Confederation,
For ono of the chief purposes of theo
expedition is to drive out of that
inland sea, the American whalers who
have been using it as their own, and
disregarding Dritish sovereignty and
Canadinn rights there.

The expedition is conveyed fn the
atout Nowfoundland gealing steamer |
Neptune, tho finest of that fleat. She
is chartered for two years, and {8 un-
der the command of Capt. S. Ww.
Bartlett, tho Newfoundland navigo-
tor, so well-known for his work in
tho Arctic regions with Peary, The |
officers and crew are also Newfound-
landers, overy one familiar with {co
work. The expeditionary, party it- |
golf 4% in charge of Mr, A. P. Low, |
of the Dominion Geological Survey,
while the ship also carries AMajor
Moodie of the Northwest Mounted
Police, who has been appointed Gov-
ernor of Hudson Bay, and will of- |
tablish a ‘fort’ or post there, . he
being accompanied by ao detaghment
of that famous corps, who will re-

Dominion authorities
to have a steamer visit Iudson Bay |

with this pofit, and perform other
neceasnry duties in that region.

The Noptune oxpedition is remark-
able®in more respects than ono, and
will deal with many matters. Firsr,
ft will rehoist the British flag “on
all the islands of the archipelago
forming the northern boundary of
Hudson Bay, and stretching away to
the confines of#the polar ocean itself;
secondly, it will expel the American
whalers from Hudson Bay and close |
that inlet to any but British. ship-
ping. These are the international as-
pects of the voyage and they are
dictated by Canada’s unpleasant ex-
perience with the United States over
the Alaskan boundary dispute. Ca-
nada claims all Arctic America, from
Baffin Land to the Yukon, but she
has done-littlg, or nothing in the
way of actual occupation, to make
good Her title, so is now repairing
this neglect before any diplomatic
friction arises. In the same wo, she
claims that Hudson Day. ds n.closed
gon; a British possession since 1718, |
but American whalers have been  al-

|

1% | to frequent it so long that
they are now acting as if they owned
it. Therefore, to prevent such a |
claim being put forward on thei be- |
half, they are now to be warned ol
and ¢xcluded herenfter.

No less important is the commer- |
cinl movement which the expedition
{s to tako cbgnizance of, “It is the
well-known project of a railway to
Hudson Bay. In support of this
scheme, it is argued that the quickest
ond cheapest way of transporting
grain from the Nowthwest to Europe
would bo by railway from Manitoba
to Fort Churchill, on the share ol
Hudson Dany, whence suitable ships
would convev it across tho Atlantic,
This routs should be 602 miles short-
or than tho present route vin Mon-
treal, and in theses days of keen eom-

petition this would form an import-
ant argument in the matter. The
schome was first advocated jn 1882,
when subsidies for. the proposed rail-
way were sought from the Canadinn:
Parliament. But, as the northern los
cation of the bay mide the question
of its navigability the essential one,
the. Dominion Government sent out
an expedition, under the late Lieut.

Y:Gordon, to thoroughly investigate it.

After a three years’ study, his report
was adverse, and the proposal drop-
ped. It was revived in 1896, and tho
next year another expedition was de-
spatched under Commander Wako
ham. It operated only one season,

but also discounted the feasibility ol

tho, scheme. Now a third trial Is
being made, scoing that the now nn-
tional transcontinental railway ‘will
pass within cnsy distance of tho bay,
and if it can bo navigated sufficiently
long cach autumn, a branch road
would enable thd bulk of the - wheal
crop to bo shipped at once by this
N being

or even spring, through lack af tran-

Inlet, where she will rchoist the
British flag at certain points and. in-
quire,into the prosecution of tho
whale fishery thore by Scotch and
American concerns, who trade with

| the natives but pay no customs dut~

fes to Canada. Itoturning south, the
ship was to enter Hudson Strait
about Sept. 10 and call at Ungoava
Bay fo send down by the Eskimos
reports and letters to Nakvak and
thence home, tho last mews that will
be had from her for a year. Procecd-
ing westward through the strait, she
is to «visit the different islands of tho
arghipelago there, hoist the British
flog nnd re-annex them. Thence she
will make her way to Chesterfield In-
lat, on tho northwest side of Hudson
Day, the favorite whaling ground.
The American whalers who winter in
tho bay make - their headquarters
there, and she will order them away,
and will go into winter quarters her-
self there to enforce the prohibition.
During the winter expeditions will bo
made into the musk-gx country to
the north, where gold is said to  ex-
jst, in the hope of<locating ~ what
may prove to be a second Klondike.
Next spring, when the ice breaks. up
and navigation is possible, she will
proceed to Port Churchill, on _.the
west side of_the bay, the proposed
terminus of the projected rollway
line, Here she will make soundings ao
to tho depth of water in the ap-
proaches. This done, she will cruise
through the bay, dragging it with
nots, to secure speclinons of fish life
wherehy ita fishery possibilities might
bo determined. She will make her
way out the strait towards tho end
of July, ‘where she will conl at Cape
Chudleigh from n vessel sont up from
Newfoundland for the purpose. Then
she will make soundings of tho reefs
about Southampton Island, the only
obstruction to the navigation of
Hudson Strait, of which this island
is counted tho western limit. She
will also cruise north to Cumberland
Gulf again and will employ her timo
until November in passing in nnd
out Hudson Strait; studying the
tides, currents, fogs nnd icefloen, re-
maining until the Intest date that
safety will. warrant, so ‘that, her
store of dnta as to the period of
commercial navigation of that water
will be tho complotest possible. It
may be, indeed,r, that she will be
frozen in thers through remaining too
long, but it is hoped she will be bisk
at St. John's, Newfoundland, in No-
vember, 1904, to bo transferred to
her owners again. Major Moodie, the
newly-appointed Governor, of the
bay, .and "his staff of police, will be
left at the: post which will be built
near Chesterfield Inlot, and Cannda’s
rule will thus be visibly demonstrat-
ed there. '
