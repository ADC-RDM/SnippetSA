TBE POLITICAL SITUATIOR.

A good deal of nonsense is bainy talk-
ed about the situation in provitcial po i=
tica since the Renfrew electon. Nr.
St Jobn who ran away from ibe cou-

; stitoency when billed to appear With
Gamey, says Mr. Ross sbould resign.
‘Why should Mr. Ross resign when hs
bas a msjority of three. The result in
Renfrew 1s no surprise and all who were
in thas constitusecy koow very well
that policé@ or public questions bad
Kittle to do with Dunlop's victory. Tre
courts will probably be asked to expose
the real argoments that contriboted
most liberally to the victory. Birmiing-
bam with his hord worked'ons crowd,
while Mr. Dunlop bad his plans mads
and nearly all executed before the Lib-
erals started. The shrewdest workers
for the Liberals never had faith that a
victory would be pulled out. Bot thas
did nct deter them from working hard
just che same, for there is always a ves

tige of hope in any fight. Bat from ao
practical standpoint, other than that of

mere party trinmph, the election Las no |

ificance whatever. North Renfrew
* goes from one side to the other with a
rush, and Mr, Dunlop stampeded the
chaogeable electorate, that's all,
and be knows how it ‘was done. Bat
as to the sitostion, Ross has three

of a majority, sufficient to carry au the |

government, though more woold have
been better. Ther are protests, several
of thew clear bluffs, again: McKay,
Little, Davis, Brown aod Smith, Liber-
al, apd Mr. St, Joho knows tbat a Lib-
éral could again Be retarned in each on
these constituencies if they were vaca-
ted. Against these are protests against
Clarke and Mahafly, Conservatives, and
there will undoabtedly be one against
Dauniop” {a Renfrew, In the matter of

ts the Liberals are no worse off
than the conservatives, and - would at

least hold their own in the bye elections. |

The y wants to stand steady, as does
Mr. y ogainst the shock of battle
There is nothing in ghe situation to
make the Liberal” party panicky, aud
when the smoke clears away and the
coantry understands the true inward
ness of the North Renfrew struggle, the
wonder will be that the Liberal candi-
date was not beaten by a thoasahd.
It was not Mr. Hale's fanlt either. Heo
is popuinr, capable and bears a good re-
putation, and will, if be choose, yet re-
present his native county in fone of the
parliaments.

The Windsor Avenoe Methodist
church is atotal rain, the result of a fire
which broke oat Monday evening The
fire was discovered by Rev. Alfred
Brown, the pastor, when he opencd the
church doors shortly before 8 o'clock, to
admit a garg of carpenters who were
abont to begin extensive repairs. to the
interior of the building. Smoke rushed
forth as the doors were opened, aud the
whole’ anditoriom was hidden in the
dense clouds, wnile the crackling of
flames could be heard in the baler
rooms down stairs. When the firemen
arrived the fire did not ajpear serioos,
and at 8 80 nothing bat smoke issnc?
from thé building, deceiving them into
thinking the flames] were extingnished.
Bat at 9 o'clock a fongue of lame leap-
ed from the rcof over the organ af the
rear and in i short time flames, spouted
from several points. Owing to the
very severd weather, the hydrants were:
frozen up and only a puny stream of
water could be raised for sometime which

gave the fire a fotal headway. Tbe |P

building is almost a total loss, ns it is
thought the walls left standing are not
worth considering. They will probably
be razed andthe edifice entirely rebuilt,
although the rear extension walls may be
used if found to be in good condition
Itis believed the fire started in the
furnace room. Thirty tons of soft coal
were destroyed. The destroyea build,
ing was’eracted in 1573 and {1a valoe 18
placed at about. $28 (00, including the
3 (00 organ sod. contents. The insar-
ance is $15,000 and this will barely “pay
the debt of 313,000 on the property. The
congregation 18 practically no betier off
financially than it was when the choreh
was crowded 90 years sgo.: The work
of raising’money to rebuild will begin
at ones, according to the trustees.

Boomer's bousebold left the buoildiog.
Thedire alarm was soanded ; the dopart-
ment replied duly.  Soddeniy, while the
hose was being played on thé fire, the
aged woman recalled’that a “little pet
canine was in peril in a room onthe sec-
ond story, She asked some of the by-
