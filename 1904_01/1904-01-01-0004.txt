ANDREW PATULLO, MP. P. for North
3 Oxford, died under very distressing cir»
cumstances in London Eng, Toesday.
He went to England a fow months ago,
to speak in sapport of the Chamberlain
fiscal policy and his speeches have made
a great impression. The strain how
over seoms to have been too
much for his physical strength
He grow ill and his heart geoms to have
been affected. He woke Tuesday morn-
ing. gasping for breath; his nephew
with whom he was stopping administer-
od restoratives and he revived. Later he
was found in hisroom dead, with his
throat cut from ear to ear, his hand still
grasping the fatal razor. Mr. Patullo’s
tragio end is deeply deplored all over the
country. He was one of the brightest
journalists and public men in Ontario,
He was electod for North Oxford in
1596 to succeed the late Sir Oliver Mow-
at, and his speeches in tho legislature
have always been foroefal and brilliant,
He dispbeed of nis interests in the Wood:
stock Sentinel Review only a few
months ago, inorder to retire from active
work. 4

MUNICIPAL N

AMHERSTBURG,

James Oraig explained why ho had
resigned from the oonnodl. t spring
ho had epont three months fixing up the
trots. Afterwards ho waa engaged at
£2 por day to oversod the constraotion of
silex walks, bat the -cooncil boat him
out of his pay. He ncoused a svation of
the connoil of holding caucus meotings
in Olay’s office and huviug everything
cut and dried before coming to coanctl.
In fact when: the committees Wore
struck ho was loft out altogether. He
referred briefly tothe electric light mud-
dle and askad for their votes. i

W. H Jones said he was not a chair-
man of any of the committees bac had
done the best he could. He tonnkod
them|foreleoting him the past year, and|if
ho is chosen as councillor for the com-
ing year he woald do the best ho could.
Ho would not canyas for votes.

T. P. Barron said he hoped he would
huve more to say this time next yoar.

Jolin A. Auld was gind to meat the
electors and thought that the large num-
ber present was n sign ‘that they were
watching their own interoata, hen ho
was » municipal officer, he was glad to
have his work oriticized. He resented
the slurs made on the waterworks by D.
H_ Terry and asserted that they could
not be pat there aow for £70,000. There
{s no other town in the Province of On-
tario hus the water up to every man's
door.He (Auld)had charge of the water
works committee for 5or 6 years snd
«hen the system was completed a pres.
aare of 125 lbs to the square inch was |
put op and held for 7 miuates Those
were the specifications under which the |
system wos accepted. The hose thav !
had boen sold lust snmmer for n mere
song was tested to n 70 lbs pressare, aud i
all it wanted was to have tho complings |
gat back, Mayor Braalt shoald staod |
by last year's statement us well as this
year. They forgot that the liability of!
Inst yoar was caused by the treasurer ri
ceiving 8524 between the 10th and 81st
of December and paying Gut #384000: ,
counts Bat it was all provi led for acoord- |
ing tothe statoment signed by the Mayor
Reforring to the dook question he (the
speaker) was the only man io Amherst
barg who stood out agunst selliog Mur |
ray stroet dock to tho Ferry Co, HE
had said so both privately’and in the col-
umns of Tae EcHo, bat the council in.
sisted on selling their birthright for $300
while he wouold not have considered
$1000 a foot, an adequate offer. Mayor
Braalt comes before us with a sohemo
to purchase <back: “from MoOlary the

Mr. McOlary tried to got o lease, bat he
never got a soratch ofA pen. Auld,
Florey, Heard and Middleditch were
members of the committe appointed to
confer with McOlary, and the matter
pever got farther than the motion The
motion said the property should revert
to the town if not used for the purpose
for which Mr. McOlary wished it The
Mullen-Gatfield Coal Go, had control of
it av the time and Mr. McClury pore
chased their lensa for 7" years, which
{ease expired Inst April, and tha proper-
ty reverted to the town. The conuoil
should make him get his old ramshackle
building off the property Referring to
the sale of the Marruy street dock ho
said he wont to Tocanto just when tLo

W.H. McEvoy said he osme to

hear the explanations mado by tho dif.
feront aspirants. When ho was a mauoi- |
cipal officer, he had been, aconsikd of
overy orime on the calendarexospt murs
der. He complivientad the chairnian of
the Finance Committss bot said there
were somo branches that .wers not so
well carried on this year aa formerly, bat
electors should be Christinolike and for-
sive the councillors who knew uo botter

aman of D. H. Verry’s calibre should

Terry ‘Ait’ and *Ait’ for your interests but
his own friends must bs sshamed of

should uot be blamed too much. ‘Poor

he had his leg pulled, that was all. Why

He believed that if the coancil went the

be induoed to extend the system to Hur-
row sud Kingsville. Undor the super:
vision of Mr, Terry the waterworks
used $1700 worth of coal during the Inst
18 months. A cost unprecedented in the
history of the town. Io December 1903,
Mr, Wigle purchased a cargo of coal
costing $358 22. On Doo. 16th, Mayor
Branlt purchased a cargo at £478.80,
while on July 4th 1903, the coancil paid
8594 19 for coal. and now there is none

ditare we had. no lights for 7 mouthsy
this year. The Inst year ha (Auld) was
in, they purchased the very best coal,
every load weighed over the town sonles
and the total cost wits only #700. The
