J. WALLACE ASKIN, on registrar of
deeds for tho county of Essex has 1ssusd
his sanual report for the year 1903, the
following of which is a summary : Total
pumber of instruments registered daring
tho year, 4.697,08 follows: Patents, 8;
deeds, 1,881; mortgages, 1,125; dis-
charges of mortgages, 1,058; wills, 80;
leases, principally ofl leases, 112; ab-
stracts furnished, 1563 ; searches, 2,250;
mechanic's liens, 18; miscellaneous, 420
The number of mortgages, 1,125, wore us
follows: Nominal, 11. those of 81,000
or under, 660; over $1,000 and not ex-
onoding $2,000, 289 ; $2,000 to $5,000, 142;
over 85,000, 28; aggregate amount of all

that the majority of the mortgnges regis-
tered are renewals of former obligations
and that others are, those which have
been given as part payment on provious
loans. The discharges of mortgages is
far above the average and points to the

A Fantastico Painting.

The nnorbld streak in human nature
was ovillenced recently by the throngs
that puuosed on Broadway to gaze at
an old painting that hung in an aue-
tioneer's: window, It-represented “The
Day of Jwmdgment.” Pits of sulphur,
ghouls, fiends, harples and serpents
were all pletured in a way to make the
blood run coldi, but the most grewsome
part of the painting was the upper left
band corner, There Napoleon Bona-
parte was -ghown standing grimly,
with folded arms, in the midst of en-
wreathing flames. The victims of his
amiflipus schemes confronted him as
pkaletons, and a dead body .plerced
with a sword was held accusingly be-
fore his eyes.

This painting wos begun by Jean
|| Cousin at Paris in 1630, The part of {t

called “Napoleon In Hell” was execut-

ed by Wiertz in 1840, and the finishing
| touches were ndded by a third artist
named Vallet. L
| 1t is a fantastic work, evidently in-
gpired in theme by Dante's “Inferno.”

It is said there is nothing else like it

in the world. Many of those who view-

ed it with a shudder say that one paint-
ing of the kind 18 enough.
