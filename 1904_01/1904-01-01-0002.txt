J. J. Brault in his opening remarks
thanked his mover and seconder for the
bonor conferred upon “him. He read
the statement of assets and liabilities as
published. In addition to this, through
an oversight, they omitted orediting
themselves with Rankin avenue side-
walk, $440 98, and licenses $230. Heo

was uuavoldable. No time was spared
to give satisfaction inthe light quesrion.

the town’s money op that way. At the
same tie Mr. Bellhonse wus looking
for a customer for all the dost. Anyway
the dust was not purchased, and when
he (the Mavor) went and tried to par-
chase 4 or 5 cars withoat success. He
then went to Grosse Isle and found
. some that was joncocssible. He
then went to Trenton ahd parchinsed at

10 cents per ton and the freight and an-

loading of ft cost considerable. money.

Tho council couldn't help themselves.

Mr. Bellhcuso subsequently pat in a

supplomentary crusher which sapplied

them with two cars and there is no
donb that after this the town can par-
chase from the Amherstbargs quarry.

He next referred to the demonstracion in

the month of September. He know that

it was a big uandartakiog * when
he began to agitate it, bat

was a success and a big advertisement

for Amherstburg. Ho assured them the

committees all worked euergetically dis-
charging their duties to the interests of
the ratepayers. Its n hard matter to
plenss everybody. He bad lost the big-
gest part of two years workiog for the
town. Some people found fanlt
with Mr. Terry for allowing the grass to

intended to sne Jones & Taylor for the

Al

ind sald ie ua lout of
a to receive nomin-
I en od be had never av
tonded the municipal nominations be«
fore. Ho had been a close observer, how:
evar, of town affaires. Ho beliaved every
council had acted to tho best interests of
the town, The difference (n tim: cansed
a difference in views, ‘Ho thinks the
oonnoil this year had noted in a fuir
representative way. Thin year tho town
is gaining in notoriety. Itismn every.
day oconrrenoe to hear of someone mak-
ing kind remarks about Amherstburg.
As solicitor of the town, he had exeroised
tho beat judgment in dealing with the
by-laws ro bonuses, eto. It's right that
any honorable gentleman would try to
got all that’s coming for the bonus. Mr.
McEvoy bad said when getting the by:
law.drawn oat, to make it binding so
that they would got all that was coming
tathem. He woald hike to see the sta:
tion in a different place, one near the
town hall and another at the other ond
of the town. The company ought to
maot the people and the people meet tho
company in a fair honorable way. . Any
effort being made by the council should
got the unanimous support of the peo-
ple. He thoaght {t mot very manly to
say the ‘clique’ will do this or that. Do
not attach motives to men which are no-
fair.. Many will not run for municipal
offices because of having their characters
pulled to pieces. To baild up the town
all must pull together. Ho did not think
but that errors in judgment had been
made, but he had seen the conncillors
working {n such a way as to show they
were working for honor, not fora sinls-
ter motive. He was pot looking for
manicipal honors himself. He found
faalt with Mr. Oraig for turning his
back oa his daty. Do not pat men in
the coancil who are all love, bunt men of
reason. Therv are timgs when jadg-
ment turns out bad, bat give credit for
honest judgment A few years ngo a
foot of land conld not be sold, excont on
the river, but this has changed snd the
town 18 belng bailt up. He could give
oheers for all the mayors, from Mr
MoEvoy down to the present mayor, for
the work they had done.” The fluautes
aro in a fairly prosperous condition,

Henry Olay said 1t has not been cos.
tomary for the oconnciliors to maks
speeches He thanked them for the
honor conferred in electing him last
yonr. The conneil had all endeavored 10
do what they they thought was right
No doubt they had made mistakes, but
claimed to have done as well at councils
in years past. They hadn't yleided to
all requests. If acconnts were not
thought right, they were rejected, which
18 the proper course for a council to tuke.
He admitted he had not noted a very
great part,bat had done his best. Ho re-
ferred to the fact that when this conncil
camo in the finances wore in bad shape,
school monies hand not been paid, county
rato ditto and $3600 due the treasurer
while the only nsset was what was on
tha collector's roll. He was one who
said tha rolls shonld be collected prompt
ly, and when he made a motion in coun-
oll to return the roll he didn’t think the
Detroit papers should criticise them
His'object was that when the nssess-rs
went ont they conld give notice of lands
in arrears so that legal tax sale could be
made. The roll was retorned on the
first day of March, and by this means
they undertook to collect the arrears of
taxes on the roll of 1807.  Coosiderable
wore paid in and 1he balance is on the

and discharge other obligations. The
real'indebtedness of the town is £2000
odd dollars, liabilities over assets, The
council has not ran behind $3000. TL
linbilities last year aro ns added |
#3171 62, and Mr. Falls forgot to carr
tho 2 and ir shonld hava been $10,171.02.
This makes liabilities over nssots of last

That was on the 15th day of December,
and between that time and going ont

could not be paid bat by overdrawing at
the bank £3650 49, which was confirmed
by a letter from the treasurer to the
auditors. Baosides this indebtedness, this
onancil paid §]003 of their acconnts. And
S24 to the Pat schools. Ho readn
comparative statement of the monios
spent shnwine that Inst year's council
spent $1657 Lire than the 1908 council.

D. H, 1iorry thanked his mover and
seconder for bis nomination, and wonld
do the same in 1904 as in 1908. Ho en

dorsed everything both the Mayor and
Mr, Clay had said He had been poand-
ed for the electric light busiuess. ” He
read a detailed statement of the monies
pald out under his committee. The six
new Inmps bought last year were no
good. The account was held until epring
and ‘hud to bo paid. The nccount for
1002 was 81076 80, He ulso gave a state.
ment of the monies spent in extensiods

The electric lights were run down, hav.
jog been run for 13 years. The dynamo
wus pat on » stone foundation but after
moving it, the dynamo barned out, and
they had to get Mr. Thomas to rewind
the dynamo, nnd he hadiboen accosed

Joho Littlo on coming forward said
ha had been shot at #0 often it failed to
have any effect. Perhaps they had
mado mistakes but they had had two
very bad seasons to contend with. The
Richmond drain hand uot been dry for
two years. Whoever was rotorued
had to clean out tha: drain, Qaite
a good deal of mousy lind been spent in
surveying bat the coonoil wanted to
find the best way to take the water ba.
fore deciding on apy coarse. Two or
threo drains had been started, and not
completed on account of the difliculey
in getting Inbor. The Inst siX'years,

Hp» thanked rae electors for their sap
por: in the pnat and asked thew for their
suffruges. lo reply to a question, ro
Orosby drain, he said that the eugineer
bad the work in hand. The contractor
had thrown ap the job becanse hesaid
the estimate was too low.

James Bailey said that he would
not run a8 councillor and causa, the
township the expense of an election.
Inghe year 1000, tho connecil had $1300
surplas which ho coaldn't flod ae pres-
ent. To fact he thooght that there wus
quite alotofiudebtedness. He thought
tho township wonld have to raise the
rato up to 10 mills in order to reéconp
themselyed or go through the insolvent
act. He next took up the gravel pic
qaestion. Hedidn'g think the town-
ship had pat any gravel on the road for
two years, He believed that the conn:
cil had allowed the man they purchased
from to flank, and let a privat party
ger in ahead of them. ' Another thing
he noticed the gravel hind been covered
by earth from the ditch nod no grade had
bepn made. He referred briefly to the
Dolson's creek drain und the Richmond
drain proposed Improvements. He
characterized both schemes not ‘what
they onght to bo He mode the broad
statement that thoy shoold not take the
amonnt of money that thé report pro-
vided for. He said that the coanell had
not put up posters advertising jobs for
sale. Ho thopght thar they had heir
pers among coutructors. He claimed
that the cooncil had considerable
tronbls with * their contractors. He
clalmed tant other councils have had
good results from letting jobs by day's
work. They should try some new
schemes. He next roferred to tha col-
lection of texes, Malden pays $80 for
collection of taxes; Gosflald South, £00,
Mersoa, $100, Gosflold North, £100, Qol-
chester Soath, 8140, Tilbary West, $75.
He claimed that no other township paid
as much for the collection of taxes ns
Colchester South. He believed that the
reason was John Affleck had four big
boys capable of putting in plumpers.
Another thing he claimed thero wasn
rumor that the townsHiip had been run
under the Drummond system for 18 or
20 years. He aonoanced that he was
not a candidate. Ho tondered them his
thanks for giving him an opportunity to
nddress thom,

Mr. Wright also had something to say
on the samo matter claiming that ax ho

‘have received the nppolotuient.
Robert Affleck stated thant the reason
Nr. Wright had not bear made colleator
was because he (Wright) bad made the
statoment thut he would collect the
(taxes promptly and pot allow texpayers
ull year to pay. The connoil were afraid
that Mr. Wright would distsain o lot. of

from the platform sayiog he woeld. like
to hear his opposition and then be given
a chance to reply.

Robt. Atkin thanked his mover and |
secopder. The first thing he would da
would be to Iny down a policy to follow
it elected. Thorownship is authorized
to collect taxes to keep the township in
good repair and not to ba spent for tha
benefit of a few, © Ho did - not think ic
right to have a different polioy for each |
part of the township; His policy would
cover every part of it. In sperdding tho
mouey on ditches it was ‘only for the
benefit of a fow.. He believed in every
man paying for his own drainage, He
thoaght money could have been saved if
contract for breakwater had been ad-
yortiged instead of being let privately,
He would have ditches measured, fully
dosoribed and sdvertised.. He did not
blame the old conne Thy bond ocar-
ried ont the policy they bad ndvoontad.
If they thonght his policy ayas batter
than the present one he woald ask them
for their support

Ed. M. Honor thanked the electors for
their shpport in the past. He was not
in tho field this year. He criticised the
flunncial Atatement at somo length. The
items of expenditure should way when
and whore money wis apent. Contract
for breakwater shonld have been adver-
tised. He believed store could have
been got cheaper from the quarry. When
he was in the council he got orushed
stcne hauled for G0 cents per yard.
Same of the council was making a haul
out of it. Now the council paid 75 conts.
This was nnothor case of private letting
of contracts The Board of Health no-
connts were too large. It was their daty
to get work done at lenst possible price
instead of doing it themsalves and charg-
ing for it. Thelr powers were the same
ns that of on council. He attriboted his
dofeat Inst year to the promises made by
Mr. Brush. He callpd on a Mr. Ogel-
letto and asked him to sapport him, Mer,
Ounelletto said Mr. Brush bad alrendy

referred to but hy would not touch it
enying he was too busy. When he came
before them Inst year he promised drain-
age should get o fuir share of expondi-
ture. They had spent more on drainnge
this year than in any year for tho past

head sayiog they could have got the
work done more ohisapiy by getting the
stoun at tho. quarry. In regardsto tho
smallpox P. D. Oampbell engaged hiz own
doaotor but tho township paid for rouning
his errands, The township did not pay for
doctoring any one this year. The lates
bills wero for famigating, visits of fn-
' spection and vaccination. By compar.
fog the fluancial statements he showed
their cost had bean wore reasonably thau
oither  ‘Anderdon - or Amhorstborg.
He did not think the taxes were any too
high, They hand a balun of $1400
Worl for balf of this amount had al-
ready been contracted for, and the Loog
Marsh-drain, when settled would wip
oat the balance, He objeoted to doing
80 mach work but was overraled. Mr.
Honor said things ehould be done above
bonrd He remembered when Mr
Honor was in the conncil a contract had
been let to bnal atone for 750. The
mun went to. Mr. Honor and complained
that he coald not do the work for thay
amount and Mr Honor oo his own
anth rity had promised him §100. Mr
Honor, xhonld have advertised the work
again. With regards tothe mivance on

Mr. Roauma. was pleased to seo so
many ratepayers and was proud to have
Mr. Pottypleco ns Reeve and Chief Mag-

the small pox opldemio in the township.
Heo then took np the flanncial statement
| and read it through from start to floish,

paired a bridge at Mr. Barna at a cost of
8256, nud one at Mr. Grondin's At n cost
of $180, ¢mnkiog a total of abont $1,700
which were badly needed. The county
rate he thought was pratt high but'the

| for the high rate. The township has to
{ pay $740 a year for six years to come on

length apparently to the satisfaction of
thoro present.
