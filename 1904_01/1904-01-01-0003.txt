that exactly one year before on the G.

ficial statement of the wreck. ‘Both

while been notified and he displayed the
red sigonl, for the west-bound train to
stop at that station. The west-bonnd

RESSION

By Bennet Musson

Copyright, 1903, by T. C. MeClure

It one wero looking for a cure for
bashfulness carbon paper would seem
an unlikely thing to select. © But It was
a pleco of this paper which, If ft*did
not exactly cure John Kendall, at lenst
avercame tho effects of his shyness,

Jobn's bashfuluess was most pernl-
clous, and, while it had not retarded
his carder as a successful manufactur
er in the flourishing town of Schuyler
ville, it proved a very embarrassing
possession when ho was smitten with
the tender passion.

In the first place, Margaret Little
was” an ‘“nuthoress,” and that along
was an awe inspiring cleecumstance. To
be able to write storles which met with
occasional acceptance, to have the post-
man sometimes bring her thin letters
containing éhecks and not to be the
grinning bearer of bulky packnges of
rejected manuscripts, placed her on a
plane above other women — in John's
eyes; not that she needed such placing,
for it would be futile to chronicle the
angelic qualities with which he ep-
dowed her.

The trouble with this endowment
process was that it was not disclosed
to Margaret. Jolin could write and did
write letters teeming with sentiment.
Of course it was unfortunate that these
letters never were sent. It was more
unfortunate that he found himself un-
able to expre#s (n her presence the feel-
ings which agitated his six fect of
manheod.

He had made three attempts at a pro-
posal, each of which had ended In
stanimering confusion and dire failure,
and it Is probable that the number
would have been extended indefinitely
had not a rival appeared on the field.

Any one who showed Margaret the
slightest attention was a rival in John's
view, and it seemed impossible that the
editor of a New York magazing would
come fifty miles to ‘Schuylerville- for
the sole purpose of consulting Aarga-
ret about a series of stories for his pe-
riodical. If this Innocent purpose
brought the editor, something emotion-
ally attractive in Margarot’s pretty
face must have induced his reappear
ance within a month, and it was dur-
ing this second visit that John spurred
himself to action.

On a Juno afternoon he deserted his
desk and determinedly strode toward
the Little homestead. His courage
usually Insted until he passed the front

ACROSS THE OROMADND CAME MANGARET
AND THE EDITOIL
gate, but on this occasion he was sur-
prised to find it upholding him even
after ho had reached the veranda. It
evaporated when he rang the bell. A
maid told him that Miss Little had
gone for a walk with the geuitleman
from New York. This Information,
coming as a resplte, at first relleved
John. Then jealiogsy renewed his
courage, and he wldly said that he
wished to leave a note for Margaret, |
In the matter of impassioned mis-
sives John Kendall was no coward,
and he sat at Mmrgoret's little desk
and dashed off a few glowing periods
on a sheet of her manuscript paper.
When the effusion was finished it
proved satisfactory, being, in fact, a
condensation of the others which he
had left unsent. He folded it neatly
and was reaching into a pigeonhole in
the desk for an envelope when he bap-
pened to glance out of the window,
Across the orchard came Margaret
and the editor. The: latter, a small,
blond, handsome mann, was walking
close beside his contributor and look-
ing smilingly into her béautiful cyes.
After viewing this scene John was
seized with panle at the thought of
Margaret's reading his note ‘lmmedi-
ately. Tho next instant he was strid-
ing away from the house, scattering
bits of white paper to the June breezes.
He did not seo Margaret for a week,
and during that time deep despair held
him for its own. Then an urgent bual-'
ness affair led him to call on her fa-
ther, who was suffering from a slight
fliness and was unable to leave his
liouso, x
When the interview with Mr. Little
was nt an end and John reached the |
front door, be found Margaret sitting
on the veranda. He thought. fo pass
her with o formal greeting, bot his In-
tentlons usually went astray where she
wis converned, and he was soon seated

“1 nm porry I

Sana veld,

your dearesMargaret.” :
John Koiall turned slowly and ro-

garded the bject of his affections with. |

bewlldenent. Heo wondered if any of |

the torn Its of paper had been picked

up and péced together by Margaret, ||

but bead scattered them so widely
thafthint seemed Impossible.

Hes Little, who had transferred her |
.| #20 from tho rosebush to her lover's |
‘Ace, seemed to enjoy his expression. |

Then John rocked violently in tho ve-
randa chair in the hope that the action
would induce mental stimulation, but
it did not.
“Will you come with me for a mo-

ment?” Margaret asked, rising and on-

tering the house,

John followed her to her study. There,
on tho little desk, was the plle of man-
uscript paper, Margaret took a note
from the bosom of her dress, unfolded
it slowly and handed it to John.

“There was a pleco of carbon paper’ |

among the top sheots,” sho sald, “and
this was under it.” And John read an
exact copy of the effusion he had ad-
dressed to Margaret the week before.

For a moment he looked helplessly

"at the note, then he glanced shyly
down at Margaret, and the expression
he saw in her eyes was entirely unlike
that with which she had regarded the
editor.

It seemed to say, “Speak for your-

self, John,” and had the stolid type-
writer which stood on the desk risen to
the occasion it would have added an-.
other love scene to ita long list.

Whims of a Great Singer,

Brignoll, the great tenor, was so
careful of bis volce when he had to
sing that he would not speak at all'and
was {no the habit of writing his wishes
on a piece of paper. During the Inst
thirty years of his life he lived at the
Everett House when not on the road.
It took him at least three-quarters of
an hour to go from his room to the
sidewalk. He must get used to the
changes very gradually. Leaving the
room, he would pace up and down the
hall for ten or fifteen minutes until
thoroughly *acclimatized,” as he bim-
self would say, and from there would
go to the lobby te experience for twen-
ty minutes a slightly lower degree of
temperature.

At the end of half an hour ho usually

reached the vestibule, where he would |

pass another quarter, opening the outer
door occasionally to get a taste of the
fresh alr. When thoroughly acclima-
tized hero he buttoned his greatcoat
close about him and stepped out on the
pavement.

Brignoll never was known to bo
ready to go on.the stage to sing his
part. He had to wait one minute or
several minutes before appearing. In
this ho was a great trouble to mana-
gers. “Just glve me one minute more,”
he would beg, and when that was up
he would plead for another and anoth-
er till all patience was exhausted.

An Artist's Struggles.

Professor von Herkomer, the famous
painter, bad-such a struggle to galn a
living in his early days that hnd it not
been for his inexhaustible stock of pa-
tience and self confidonce ho would
probably bave abandoned art entirely.
He sold his first picture for 2 guineas
and Iater on earned for a short time a
couple of pounds weekly for a wood-
cut which he supplied to a comic pa-
per. This modest salary coming: to a
stop, lie was at his wits’ end to know
what to do, He applied to a troupe of
minstrels for an engagement as sither
player. but in vain, nnd then took to de-
slgnimg carpets. For some years he
battled with poverty, achieving no suc.
eens untill he obtained employment on
a weekly illustrated journal.—London
