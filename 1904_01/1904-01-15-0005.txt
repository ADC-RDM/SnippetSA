Clothing critically and you will be surprised to see how it's
made : what factories shirk in Ready-to-wear Clothing, we -
put in. That's why our Clothing keeps its shape longer than
any other makes. Again we make for the consumer, there-
fore study the consumer and save you, besides giving you a
better fit, the middle man's price. Quality speaks, and the
quality we have pution the market for upwards of a quarter
of a century is speaking now to such an extent that in every

are no strangers to Oak Hall, everybody knows us, and to
everybody we wish a Happy and Prosperous. New Year.
